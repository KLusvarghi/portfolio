    "Full Stack Developer with over 4 years of experience and an obsession with solid fundamentals. With a consolidated foundation in front-end and growing expertise in back-end, I build solutions thinking about architecture, scalability, and impact from the first commit, which allows me not only to use tools but to understand the why behind them, something critical in an AI-dominated landscape. My differentiator? I see problems as business opportunities: I visualize practical MVPs, dive deep into the product core, and think about how to deliver real business value. I use AI to accelerate the path from idea to solution, but always with clear concepts guiding every technical decision.",
